# Welcome!
This repository will showcase a detailed introduction to Ansible from learner's perspective. We will also include projects that we have developed and are currently developing. If you are new to Ansible, I would highly recommend starting with the [Ansible community documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/). Learning how to read any technical documentation is an essential skill when working in the IT/IS career field.

## Why we started?
The need for Ansible arose as we began scaling our infrastructure horizontally. As most new administrators will realize, manually configuring every machine in your environment is not practical, efficient, or effective. Manual configuration is prone to human error which can lead to security oversights like unpatched servers or poorly configured default settings. Ansible allows for the management of multiple devices from a single point: the Control Node.

# Current Projects [WIP & Complete]
This section outlines our current and in-progress playbooks that we have implemented or plan to implement in our production environment. These projects will range from basic host management, to more advance application deployment and security automations. Projects will be listed with their current level of implementation and development.
